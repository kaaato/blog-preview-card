## My process

1. Do research about things that I didn't know from reading through the guideline. This is actually required throughout the process.
2. Start HTML with semantic elements and try to make a layout that help to style easier with css later.
3. Start CSS after completing the first draft of HTML. 
4. Go back and update both files wherever necessary.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Things I learnt from previous challenge
- [CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - Andy Bell

### What I learned

- How to use and write @font-face{}

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "femFigtree";
  src: url("assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
}
```

- Flexbox

### Continued development

- Choice of HTML elements, naming HTML classes and layout design in general.
